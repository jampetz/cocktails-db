        Alcohol has been produced and consumed by humans for its psychoactive
        effects for almost 10,000 years. Drinking alcohol is generally socially
        acceptable and is legal in most countries, unlike with many other
        recreational substances. However, there are often restrictions on
        alcohol sale and use, for instance a minimum age for drinking and laws
        against public drinking and drinking and driving.
